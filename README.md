### Ionic V5
The project is based on ionic v5.2.

* To uinstall the current version, and install the 5.2 version
```bash
npm uninstall -g ionic && npm install -g ionic@5.2.0
```
* The Ionic devapp can be used to test the project, before building the actual app. The Ionic Devapp is not available from the app/play stores, so I included the Android verion I have, in the Ionic_Devapp folder.
```bash
ionic serve --devapp
```
